    branches:
      - main  # Trigger on pull request to main branch

jobs:
  # First Job: Test the Python script
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Define the platform

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:

      # Step 3: Install dependencies (pytest)
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip

      # Step 4: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          pytest test_my_script.py

  # Second Job: Deploy if tests pass
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: test  # Only run if test job is successful

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code again
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up SSH for deployment
      - name: Set up SSH
        uses: webfactory/ssh-agent@v0.5.3
        with:
          ssh-private-key: ${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}  # Add SSH private key in GitHub secrets

      # Step 3: Deploy the Python file to the remote server (e.g., customer robot)
      - name: Deploy Script to Remote Server
        run: |
          scp my_script.py user@remote_server_ip:/home/user/  # Replace with your server info
